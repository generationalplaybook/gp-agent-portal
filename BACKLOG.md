# Backlog

Things Karina has asked to defer to a future build, so they don't get lost.

## Requested, not yet built

- **First / Last / Middle name split.** Right now "name" is a single field everywhere.
  Needs to become separate First Name / Last Name (required) and Middle Name (optional)
  fields, on both:
  - Advisor accounts (the invite form and My Profile)
  - Client records (new client form, client profile contact info, Client Analyzer)

- **Better home page.** The landing page after login is minimal right now. Karina wants
  something more useful here, but said not to worry about it yet.

- **Downloads section.** Left alone for now — no changes requested yet.

- **Presentation embed / training & licensing content.** Karina is still building the
  presentation materials; she said we can add this once that's ready.

- **Brand the invite/auth emails.** Right now invite emails come from Supabase's default
  "Supabase Auth" sender with generic wording/styling ("You've been invited... powered by
  Supabase"). Needs custom branding (sender name, wording, maybe logo/colors) to match GP
  Advisor Portal. Likely involves customizing the email templates in Supabase's dashboard
  (Authentication → Email Templates) and possibly a custom SMTP sender down the line.

- **Manage / remove advisors.** The "Your Team" list on the Invite Agents page currently only
  lets an admin change someone's role (Advisor/Admin) via a dropdown. There's no way to remove
  an advisor's access entirely (e.g. someone leaves the team). Needs a "Remove" action —
  likely disabling/deleting their profile access rather than deleting their Supabase auth user
  outright, so their historical client data/notes aren't orphaned. Worth deciding: should a
  removed advisor's clients get reassigned to someone, or just become admin-only visible?

- **Minor clients / guardian tracking.** When the main person on a policy is under 18 at the
  time they're added, need a pop-up (on the new client form, and probably editable later) to
  capture a parent/legal guardian's info — they're effectively the policy owner while the
  client is a minor. Specifics from Karina:
  - Guardian needs their own contact fields (name, phone, email at minimum — same shape as a
    client's contact info).
  - Reminders for a minor client should go to/surface the guardian's contact info, not the
    minor's, since the guardian is who the advisor is actually dealing with.
  - Need to track the minor's 18th birthday. On that date, ownership of the policy
    conceptually transfers from the guardian to the (now adult) client.
  - Explicitly NO automated email to the client on their 18th birthday — Karina confirmed
    this. Instead: auto-create a reminder for the advisor (reusing the existing reminders
    system) so the advisor knows to reach out and have that "you're 18, here's what changes"
    conversation themselves.
  - Needs: a `is_minor`/guardian fields added to the clients schema (another Supabase
    migration, same pattern as the birth_date fix), a guardian-capture UI on the new/edit
    client form gated on birth_date implying age < 18, and a daily scheduled check (Vercel
    Cron Job hitting a small API route — NOT anything in this chat tool's scheduling system)
    that finds clients turning 18 that day and creates the advisor reminder automatically.
  - Karina's call: build this AFTER the invite-link fix ships and her team starts testing —
    do not bundle into tonight's deploy.

## Technical follow-up

- **Server action error handling.** Discovered while fixing the Invite Agents crash:
  Next.js hides any THROWN error from a server action behind a generic message in
  production ("Minified React error #441..."), even when the code does
  `throw new Error("some helpful message")`. The invite/role actions were rewritten to
  return `{ ok, error }` instead of throwing, which fixes it there. Other action files
  (client notes, tasks, reminders, analyses) still use the throw pattern — they haven't
  caused a reported issue yet, but the same silent-masking risk applies to all of them.
  Worth a pass to convert them the same way if more mystery "#441" errors show up.

## Blocked on Karina

- **Phase 6 — carrier PDFs.** Need 6 missing carrier PDF files (Ameritas Life,
  Ameritas Annuities, Nationwide Life, Nationwide Annuities, MOO Life, MOO Annuities)
  to wire into the Downloads page's `downloads-data.ts`.

- **Terms of Service text.** `src/lib/terms.ts` currently has clearly-labeled placeholder
  text for the "Proprietary Technology Notice" agents accept on first login. Needs
  Karina's real, verbatim legal text before this is production-ready.
