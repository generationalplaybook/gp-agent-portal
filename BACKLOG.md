# Backlog

Things Karina has asked to defer to a future build, so they don't get lost.

## Requested, not yet built

- **Death Benefit Option explainer for advisors.** Karina wants a clear way to teach her
  advisors the three death benefit structures — Level, Increasing, and (per her phrasing)
  "level to increasing" — what each does and when to use which. Explicitly told not to build
  this yet (8/27), just capture the idea. Note: the Level vs. Increasing (Option 1 vs Option 2)
  comparison already exists as a Knowledge Base concept entry today (what it is / does /
  agent note / client-facing explanation / highlights) — worth showing her that before
  building anything new, since it may already cover most of this. Open questions for when we
  pick this up: what exactly is the third "level to increasing" option (a policy that switches
  DBO over time, which the KB only mentions in passing under a couple of NA product notes —
  may need its own writeup), and whether she wants this as more Knowledge Base content, a
  short training/quiz mode, or something surfaced directly inside the Client Analyzer flow
  when a death benefit option is being chosen for an actual client.

- **First / Last / Middle name split — built 8/29.** First Name / Last Name (required) and
  Middle Name (optional) are now separate fields everywhere someone's name gets entered or
  edited: the invite form, My Profile, the new client form, the client profile's contact info,
  and the "Add New Person" flow inside Family. `full_name` still exists on both `clients` and
  `profiles` and everything that displays a name keeps reading it unchanged — it's now
  auto-computed by a database trigger from first/middle/last, so nothing should write to it
  directly anymore. Existing rows were backfilled by splitting the old full_name on the first
  space; anyone whose name didn't split cleanly (a single-word name, or one that already had a
  middle name jammed into one field) can just re-enter it correctly once in the UI.
  - **Left as one field on purpose:** the Client Analyzer's "Client Name" box. That tool is a
    scratch illustration calculator (not a saved record), so it just needs a name to print on
    the output — splitting it wouldn't connect to anything. Flag if you want it split too.

- **Better home page.** The landing page after login is minimal right now. Karina wants
  something more useful here, but said not to worry about it yet.

- **Downloads section.** Left alone for now — no changes requested yet.

- **Presentation embed / training & licensing content.** Karina is still building the
  presentation materials; she said we can add this once that's ready.

- **Brand the invite/auth emails.** Right now invite emails come from Supabase's default
  "Supabase Auth" sender with generic wording/styling ("You've been invited... powered by
  Supabase"). Needs custom branding (sender name, wording, maybe logo/colors) to match GP
  Advisor Portal. Likely involves customizing the email templates in Supabase's dashboard
  (Authentication → Email Templates) and possibly a custom SMTP sender down the line.

- **Manage / remove advisors.** The "Your Team" list on the Invite Agents page currently only
  lets an admin change someone's role (Advisor/Admin) via a dropdown. There's no way to remove
  an advisor's access entirely (e.g. someone leaves the team). Needs a "Remove" action —
  likely disabling/deleting their profile access rather than deleting their Supabase auth user
  outright, so their historical client data/notes aren't orphaned. Worth deciding: should a
  removed advisor's clients get reassigned to someone, or just become admin-only visible?

- **Minor clients / guardian tracking.** When the main person on a policy is under 18 at the
  time they're added, need a pop-up (on the new client form, and probably editable later) to
  capture a parent/legal guardian's info — they're effectively the policy owner while the
  client is a minor. Specifics from Karina:
  - Guardian needs their own contact fields (name, phone, email at minimum — same shape as a
    client's contact info).
  - Reminders for a minor client should go to/surface the guardian's contact info, not the
    minor's, since the guardian is who the advisor is actually dealing with.
  - Need to track the minor's 18th birthday. On that date, ownership of the policy
    conceptually transfers from the guardian to the (now adult) client.
  - Explicitly NO automated email to the client on their 18th birthday — Karina confirmed
    this. Instead: auto-create a reminder for the advisor (reusing the existing reminders
    system) so the advisor knows to reach out and have that "you're 18, here's what changes"
    conversation themselves.
  - Needs: a `is_minor`/guardian fields added to the clients schema (another Supabase
    migration, same pattern as the birth_date fix), a guardian-capture UI on the new/edit
    client form gated on birth_date implying age < 18, and a daily scheduled check (Vercel
    Cron Job hitting a small API route — NOT anything in this chat tool's scheduling system)
    that finds clients turning 18 that day and creates the advisor reminder automatically.
  - Karina's call: build this AFTER the invite-link fix ships and her team starts testing —
    do not bundle into tonight's deploy.
  - **Partially covered as of 8/27** by the new family-linking feature (a guardian/parent can
    now be linked to a minor client as a "Parent"-relationship family member, and the family
    card on the client page already flags minors and highlights anyone turning 18 within 90
    days).
  - **Further covered as of 8/27 (later same day)** by the Products feature's
    `owner_client_id` field (a product can be owned by a different linked family member — e.g.
    a parent owns a child's juvenile policy) plus a daily Vercel Cron job
    (`src/app/api/cron/check-birthdays/route.ts`, `vercel.json`) that runs automatically: on a
    client's 18th birthday it transfers any product they're covered under but don't yet own to
    them, and creates the advisor a reminder to have the "you're 18 now" conversation. No
    automated email goes to the client, per Karina's earlier instruction.
  - What's still missing: dedicated guardian-only contact fields (right now a guardian is just
    another linked client record, not a distinct role), and routing a minor's day-to-day
    reminders to the guardian specifically rather than just showing the guardian nearby.

## Technical follow-up

- **Server action error handling.** Discovered while fixing the Invite Agents crash:
  Next.js hides any THROWN error from a server action behind a generic message in
  production ("Minified React error #441..."), even when the code does
  `throw new Error("some helpful message")`. The invite/role actions were rewritten to
  return `{ ok, error }` instead of throwing, which fixes it there. Other action files
  (client notes, tasks, reminders, analyses) still use the throw pattern — they haven't
  caused a reported issue yet, but the same silent-masking risk applies to all of them.
  Worth a pass to convert them the same way if more mystery "#441" errors show up.

## Blocked on Karina

- **Phase 6 — carrier PDFs.** Need 6 missing carrier PDF files (Ameritas Life,
  Ameritas Annuities, Nationwide Life, Nationwide Annuities, MOO Life, MOO Annuities)
  to wire into the Downloads page's `downloads-data.ts`.

- **Terms of Service text.** `src/lib/terms.ts` currently has clearly-labeled placeholder
  text for the "Proprietary Technology Notice" agents accept on first login. Needs
  Karina's real, verbatim legal text before this is production-ready.
